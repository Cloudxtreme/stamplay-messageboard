##Building A Realtime Message Board with Stamplay and Pusher

We will use the Stamplay platform to build a fully featured realtime message board. In this tutorial we will :

 - Send a welcome email when a user signs up.
 - Allow users to login/signup with Github.
 - Allow users to post new messages.
 - Update users messages realtime using the [Pusher API](https://pusher.com/) with Stamplay.


-----------------------
## Requirements
To get started, make sure you have the following. Don't worry they all have a free account.
 - A [Stamplay](http://editor.stamplay.com/apps) account.
 - A [Github](https://github.com/) account.
 - A [Pusher API](https://pusher.com/) account.

Alright! Lets build our realtime message board!
